* General Information

This tool was developed during the Masters course /Hardware Design/ at the /Johannes Kepler University/. It implements
the basic method of circuit verification by means of /Symbolic Computer Algebra/ (SCA). In the following we give a brief
description of this method. The interested reader is encouraged to study the relevant literature(*TODO*) for more
details.

** SCA
A circuit is comprised of /input wires/, /output wires/ and /logic gates/ that are also connected via wires. Every
circuit gate implements some elementary boolean function such as a logical /AND/, /XOR/, etc. Every gate also induces a
polynomial relationship between the inputs and output of the gate. The following lists the corresponding polynomial
relation for some basic boolean function:

\begin{align}
c = a \land b \implies 0 = c - a \cdot b
\end{align}
